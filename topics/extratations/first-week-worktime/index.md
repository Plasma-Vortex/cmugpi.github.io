# First Week Worktime
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

We'll just be having a bit of time where you can get help from the TAs on the
first week's setup and first lab. It's basically like office hours.

There are no notes for this week's extratation. You'll want to see:

- [Initial Setup]
- [Files & Commands] (the week 1 reading)

[Initial Setup]: {{ "/initial-setup/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[Files & Commands]: {{ "/topics/terminal-usage/files-commands/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
