# Linux Installation Lab
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

## Why should I install Linux?

- It's super easy to install almost any software you want with a package
  manager. No more sketchy software from the Internet.
  - In particular, this makes it particularly good for developing software.
- You'll have more control, and more options for customizing anything from your
  window manager to how your computer handles running out of RAM to being able
  to access your AFS files without SSH.
- There's a huge community that responds to bugs and requests.
- Linux has a large and growing gaming community.
- Linux lets you Use all the powerful tools you've learned this semester on your
  own computer instead of CMU's, especially if you're currently have Windows.
- Linux won't spy on you like Windows 10 does.

## What do I need to do to prepare?

- Have a Linux image on a USB drive ([steps, windows][linux-usb-stick-win],
  [steps, osx][linux-usb-stick-osx]).

  After the extratation, if you want to undo these steps, you can look make
  your USB drive [usable again][linux-reformat-usb].
