# Syllabus
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

## Overview

The purpose of GPI is to teach you all kinds of cool things you never knew you
could do with a computer, and make you super comfortable with using the Unix
systems used in 15-122, 15-213, and many other CS courses.

Our goal for the course is for you to have a fun break from your other classes,
and an opportunity to see some real uses for what you're learning about.

We will meet on Thursdays from 3:00 - 4:20 in WEH 7500. Each instructor and TA
will also be holding office hours. Times for office hours will be announced on
Piazza.

## Homework

Each week you will get a short reading about the next week's topic on the
schedule. Every week except the first, will have a "QuickCheck" to accompany the
reading. QuickChecks will only ask you to type in a few commands from the
reading. You will have the entire week to read and complete the QuickCheck

## Lecture

The first 15 minutes of lecture will be a discussion of the reading, where a TA
will go over the content of the reading and answer questions.

After the talk, will be a series of puzzles that require that weeks topic to
solve. Each set of puzzles are called that week's 'PuzzlePacks'. The PuzzlePacks
are composed of terminal/Unix puzzles involving typing in the right command,
writing a simple script, or reading some code to figure out what it's
doing.

The PuzzlePacks are designed to be completable in class, but if you don't
finish, you will have all of the following week to complete it. If you need more
time for any reason just ask for an extension.

## Office Hours

At office hours you can ask TAs for help with PuzzlePacks, or help
understanding that week's reading.

## Tests

There will be an in-class midterm exam which will have questions similar to
those on the QuickChecks. It will only cover material from the first half of the
course.

## Grading

All the PuzzlePacks thoughout the entire semester will collectively be 70% of
you final grade for the course. All the reading-checks thoughout the entire
semester will collectively be 10% of your grade. The midterm will be 20% of your
grade. There is no final exam.

## Collaboration Policy

On both QuickChecks and PuzzlePacks, you...

- may use manual (`man`) pages for commands in question.
- may use Google to learn how to use a command/solve a problem.
- may ask TAs for help.

In addition, the following policies apply to their respective categories.

### PuzzlePacks

You may point peers to particular commands, but refrain from describing a
solution to a problem that uses specific commands' arguments or combinations of
commands.

### QuickChecks

You may not interact with or ask other students for help.

## Help

If at any point during the semester you're having trouble with anything in the
course or want to know more about a topic, please do not hesitate to email the
course staff or ask one of us in person! We're here to help you and want you to
learn!
