# Emacs Fundamentals
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

Are you not relishing the prospect of learning mean old vim?
Solve your problems by learning friendly, exciting Emacs!
Come to the two Emacs extratations!

Also, are you unable to save in Emacs? I bet you're taking 122!
(The 122 Emacs configuration is broken.)
Follow the minimal preparation steps below and you will be able to save again!

Only minimal preparation is necessary for the Emacs extratations.

[This document](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html) contains some small nuggets
of useful knowledge.
But you only need part of it.

You should read and execute sections
[1.4 Emacs tutorial](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-4)
and
[1.6.1 Emacs installed on unix.andrew.cmu.edu](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-6-1).

If you are using OS X, you will unfortunately need to also do
[1.3 Special problems OS X users need to fix](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-3).

It's not essential, but it's quite straightforward and it would
make you a cool person if you would also read and execute sections
[1.5.1 Installing Emacs](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-5-1)
and the appropriate parts of
[1.6 Bare essentials of configuration](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-6).

Also if you feel like wasting time,
[1.7.1 Games](http://cmu.io/~sbaugh/emacs.html#sec-1-7-1).
