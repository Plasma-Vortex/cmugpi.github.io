## Homework

This week's homework isn't on lern2unix. It's composed of two parts.

1. [Learn Git Branching][learnGitBranching]
  - Do the "Introduction Sequence", which amounts to the first four exercises.
2. [Branching Exercise Repo][branching-exercise]
  - Make a __GitHub account__ (if you haven't already), and record your username
    on this form: [Github Username][google-form].
  - Fork the Git Branching repository.
  - Fix up the repo. (Hint: check the README of the repo!)
  - Submit a pull request so we can see your solution!
