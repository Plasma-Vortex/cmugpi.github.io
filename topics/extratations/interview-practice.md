##

- You can't really teach someone how to interview well.
- You can make them aware of certain things so that they can
  improve.
- At the end of the day, it's all about practicing.

# About the Process

## Review a few things before an interview

- Review common data structures
    - You will learn/are learning them in 122
    - You'll learn even more in 210 next year
- Review common algorithm questions.
    - Don't mess up on an easy question!
- Make sure your resume doesn't mention anything you're not
  comfortable talking about.
- Look into what the company does.
    - They'll usually ask  you, "Why do you want to work
      here?"

## Pre-interview Routines

- Have a pre-inteview "routine" that gets you ready to do an
  interview.
    - Example: smile into a mirror for 5 minutes
        - If its on-site and I'm in a waiting room, I just
          cover my mouth and smile.

- Do anything you can to improve your confidence before
  going in.


## Interviews are all about talking & communicating

- You're most likely being interviewed by an engineer.
- They don't expect you to be the biggest algorithm master
  on the planet.
- They want to make sure that if you get hired that they'd
  be happy to have you on their own team.
- Be excited about the company.
    - Don't let the interviewer get the vibe that this isn't
      your first choice.
- Make sure to always be talking about your thought process.
    - If there's a span of time where it's completely silent
      you are doing something wrong.
    - Always be explaining what you're thinking about and
      what you're writing.

## The types of questions vary wildly

- For the most part, you won't get asked terribly difficult
  interview questions.
- Most interview questions you'll encounter will be easily
  solved using a hashtable.
- Interview questions are meant to be solvable in a short
  amount of time, but usually there are multiple stages to
  the answers.

# Answering Questions

## How to solve interview questions

- Always give the worst answer first.
    - If you immediately have a solution to a problem, even
      if it is super slow, say it.
    - I cannot stress the importance of this enough.
    - You absolutely MUST let the interviewer know that you
      can solve it.
- After that, you can try and optimize it.
    - Remember that the interviewer isn't just trying to
      make sure you know how to solve these problems
    - He/she is trying to see how you go about solving the
      problems.
- If all goes wrong, chances are the interviewer is going to
  give you a hint.
    - They understand that there's pressure to solve the
      problem.
    - If an interviewer gives you a hint, run with it.


# Practice Time!

## Common Linked List questions

- Print out the elements in a linked list in order.
- Detect a cycle in a linked list.
- Reverse a linked list.

## Final tips

- Don't take it personally if you don't get good news.
    - Two interviewers at the same company will ask you
      completely different questions and would conclude
      different things
    - Just because you didn't pass with one doesn't mean you
      are not good enough.
    - Don't believe me?
    - <http://blog.triplebyte.com/who-y-combinator-companies-want>
- Don't get arrogant after getting offers.
    - Future interviewers will detect your arrogance and
      that's a huge turn off.
