## Overview

Bash is one of the most commonly used shell scripting languages. It is what's
run every time you open a terminal, ssh into a server, or run a shell script
(unless you've changed it to run a similar program like ksh or zsh).

Bash is an incredibly powerful development tool. It makes automating certain
tasks incredibly easy, saving you time and headaches. A working knowledge of
bash is also a valuable skill when looking for employment in the tech industry.
Interviewers enjoy asking potential candidates questions that test their
knowledge of the shell environment.

All in all, investing a little time into learning the basics of bash is a very
rewarding endeavor.
