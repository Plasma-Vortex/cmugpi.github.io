# 15-131 -- Great Practical Ideas in CS
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

## Overview

Throughout your education as a Computer Scientist at Carnegie Mellon, you will
take courses on programming, theoretical ideas, logic, systems, etc. As you
progress, you will be expected to pick up the so-called "tools of the trade."
This course is intended to help you learn what you need to know in a friendly,
low-stress, high-support way. We will discuss UNIX, LaTeX, debugging and many
other essential tools.

For more information, you should checkout the [syllabus][syllabus].


## How to use this site

This site is broken up into a number of _Topics_ which are further broken up
into _Lessons_. One topic in particular relates directly to the assignments in
this class: Puzzle Packs. The PuzzlePack topic is where you can find links to
the PuzzlePack we will be doing in class as well as the lessons that will be
useful in for solving that PuzzlePack. These are linked below for your
convenience.

In general, there are more lesson pages than there are PuzzlePacks. You only
have to read those not directly linked from the PuzzlePack lessons if you're
interested. You will only be assessed on your knowledge of those that relate to
solving the PuzzlePacks.
