The 'PuzzlePack' for this week is to customize your bash prompt using this week's
reading, and post a screenshot of it on [Piazza]. Try to put your andrew id in your
prompt where we can see it, and include the contents of your PS1 variable, either
echo it in the screenshot, or post it as a comment.
