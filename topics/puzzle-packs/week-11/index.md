## Download PuzzlePack

The 'PuzzlePack' for this week is to customize your Bash prompt, so get
creative! You can find a lot of good examples on the [Terminal
Configuration][termconf] topic page; in particular, [this is a good quick
reference][prompt-settings].

### Handin Instructions

Please submit a picture of your prompt to AFS. To do this,

1. Name your file `week11-prompt.jpg` or `week11-prompt.png`
1. `scp` your file to AFS
1. Run `aklog cs.cmu.edu` (this is required to be able to write to the GPI
   course handin folder)
1. Move your image to the folder
   `/afs/cs/academic/class/15131-f15/users/f15/ANDREWID/`, replacing your
   AndrewID as appropriate.

Feel free to also post the screenshot to Piazza!
