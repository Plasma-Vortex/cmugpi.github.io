## GPI Vim Config

Like many Unix tools, Vim is heavily configurable. Unfortunately, this means
that it's not very well-configured out of the box.

If you don't already have a Vim configuration, you should start with the GPI Vim
config. You might have already installed this configuration when you did the
[initial setup][initial-setup] instructions, but if you didn't, run
`gpi_install` and choose the `vim_config` package.

[initial-setup]: {{ "/initial-setup/" | prepend: site.baseprefix }}

## Jump Right In

Vim is best learned interactively. With this in mind, the first thing you
should do is work through `vimtutor`, a program that launches `vim` with a
tutorial file to help you learn. Go run `vimtutor` and work through it now...
we'll wait!

## [Learning Vim in 2014][learning-vim]: The Basics

The link above is to an excellent walkthrough that approaches Vim from the
standpoint of a 21st century user, a user for whom graphical interfaces are the
norm and who might view Vim, a piece of software dating back to 1976, as
"outdated." Since these pieces are so well-written, we'll be substituting them
for content written by members of the GPI staff.
